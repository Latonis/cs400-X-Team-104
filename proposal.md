# X-Team 104 Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: MyPersonalLibrary stores your books collection, information about each book, user entered details, and time spent reading each book.
* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
## Problem Description

People who love to read, really love to read. Sometimes it can be hard to keep track of what books you've already read, which ones you have yet to read, etc. Wouldn't it help to be able to track your reading activity in a more dynamic way? A personal library application could help solve that.

The app would track books via ISBN. Author, title, page count, cover, etc. would all be listed. Also, status updates on read, not read, how much progress they've made, etc.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)



2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include and example format of the output produced.



3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.



5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
