# X-Team 104 Project Proposal: MyPersonalLibrary
  
## Project Description

People who love to read, really love to read. Sometimes it can be hard to keep track of what books you've already read, which ones you have yet to read, etc. Wouldn't it help to be able to track your reading activity in a more dynamic way? A personal library application could help solve that.

The application would track books via ISBN. Author, title, page count, cover, etc. would all be listed. Also, status updates on read, not read, how much progress they've made, etc.

Project Title: MyPersonalLibrary

Project Output: An organized list of books and detailed information of each book.

Project Input: Users will enter the reletive information about the books they want to keep record of.

Project User Interface: We can have interfaces like Book class and Booklist class. Book class stores fields of detailed information about one book, like title, author, ISBN and genre. Booklist class is for organization of a list of books. 

Project Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.

Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
