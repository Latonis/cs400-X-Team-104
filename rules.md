# X-Team 104 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will have open discussions about what tasks people would prefer to take on. In the event that no one wants to take a task on, we will assign it to the person with the most experience in that particular area.

## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will have weekly discussion for each person's part, so all members can report and understand the tasks progress.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will discuss it immediately and solve it. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Teammates will check in on each other as time progresses, and if a part has not been completed yet, we will contact them to ensure no one is struggling or needs help. 


## How will we share study materials with team members
We will communicate by texts and share files or notes on github if necessary.
